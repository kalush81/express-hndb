{{!-- <h1>Hello, you can add any message here. All messages here run only on RAM, not on the hard disk. By default, they last
    up to 30 minutes.</h1>
<h2>Now we can see all the messages because they are under one and the same link, and the application has not yet been
    developed.</h2>
<h2>Finally, each message will create its own unique URL link
    which you then send to the recipient.</h2>
<h2>It is up to the recipient to delete the message, if not, the message will disappear within 30 minutes.</h2> --}}
